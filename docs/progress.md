# Nue Blog App - Progress Report

This document outlines the progress made in developing the Nue Blog App, a full-featured blog application built with Nuejs.

## Project Setup

We've established a comprehensive project structure following Nuejs best practices:

```

```

## Implemented Features

### 1. Global Configuration and Styling

- Created `site.yaml` with global site configuration
- Implemented global layout with header and footer
- Added CSS variables for colors and typography
- Created responsive layout styles

### 2. Authentication System

- Created login and signup pages
- Implemented login form component (`login-form.dhtml`)
- Implemented signup form component (`signup-form.dhtml`)
- Added user profile page and component (`user-profile.dhtml`)
- Implemented authentication model with mock functionality

### 3. Blog System

- Created blog listing page
- Implemented dynamic blog post template (`[slug].md`)
- Added blog post creation/editing component (`blog-editor.dhtml`)
- Created sample blog post content

### 4. Comments System

- Implemented comments list component (`comments-list.dhtml`)
- Created comment form component (`comment-form.dhtml`)
- Added comment model with mock data

### 5. Additional Pages

- Created About page with team information
- Implemented Contact page with form submission
- Added Portfolio page with project showcase
- Created Case Studies page

### 6. Database Integration

- Defined Prisma schema with models for:
  - Users
  - Posts
  - Comments
  - Tags
  - Contact Submissions
  - Portfolio Items
  - Case Studies
- Created mock data models for development

### 7. Application Logic

- Implemented model layer with:
  - Authentication (`auth.js`)
  - Blog posts (`blogs.js`)
  - Comments (`comments.js`)
  - Users (`users.js`)
  - Contact form (`contact.js`)
- Added bootstrap controller for initialization

## Current State

The application currently has a complete structure with all major components implemented. The UI is fully functional with mock data, demonstrating the following user flows:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - User can sign up for a new account
   - User can log in to an existing account
   - User can view and edit their profile
   - User can log out

2. **Content Management**:
   - User can view blog posts
   - Authenticated users can create new blog posts
   - Authenticated users can edit their own blog posts

3. **Interaction**:
   - Authenticated users can comment on blog posts
   - Users can delete their own comments

4. **Information Pages**:
   - About page with team information
   - Portfolio showcase
   - Case studies
   - Contact form

## Mock vs. Production

Currently, the application uses mock data instead of real database connections:

- Authentication uses localStorage for session management
- Blog posts and comments are stored in memory
- Form submissions are logged but not stored

This approach allows for development and testing without a database connection while maintaining the same interface that would be used with a real database.

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

We've implemented a mix of static and interactive components:

- Static components (`.html`) for layout and structure
- Interactive components (`.dhtml`) for user interactions

### State Management

The application uses a simple model-based state management approach:

- Central model object with methods for data operations
- Event system for communication between components
- Local component state for UI-specific state

### Styling

The styling follows a modular approach:

- Global variables for consistent theming
- Component-specific styles for encapsulation
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
