# Getting Started with Nue.js

Nue.js is a modern web framework that prioritizes web standards, enabling developers to create large-scale single-page applications (SPAs) with less code than mainstream tools require.

## Why Nue.js?

Nue.js offers several advantages:

1. **Simplicity**: Write less code and maintain a cleaner codebase
2. **Performance**: Faster rendering and smaller bundle sizes
3. **Standards-first**: Built on web standards rather than proprietary abstractions
4. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API and excellent documentation

## Getting Started

To start a new Nue.js project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
npm create nue@latest my-nue-app
cd my-nue-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Nue.js project and start the development server.

## Conclusion

Nue.js is an excellent choice for developers who want to build modern web applications without the complexity of other frameworks. Give it a try and see how it can simplify your development process!
